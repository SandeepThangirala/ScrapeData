Since I read a lot, and have had several people ask me for my favorite books recently I want to make this public post. \n\nI want to start with a plug for the power of audiobooks. In 2015 alone, I listened to 791 hours of audiobooks or roughly 100 books, simply by listening when doing other tasks like making dinner, walking to class, cleaning my room, riding the bus, etc. I am 20 times more competent and more intelligent today, than I ever could have been without audiobooks. If you are an auditory learner, and especially if you find reading difficult, you should listen to audiobooks using Audible: http://amzn.to/29jG5Xg, they are running a deal right now that gives you two audiobooks for free.\n\nI picked some of my favorite books I've read and included them below. Many of them are the first in a series so you can go in deeper from there if you'd like.\n\nFor entrepreneurship:\nThe 4 hour work week http://amzn.to/28ZJXQj Should be at the top of your list. Best book about entrepreneurship I have ever read. Stick out the first chapter. Then it will start blowing your mind.\nHow to win friends and influence people http://amzn.to/2948tyy Should be at the top of your list.\nThe Lean Startup: http://amzn.to/28ZKIIM. The Silicon Valley bible for product building and building minimum viable products.\nI will teach you to be rich: http://amzn.to/28XsSBz. Best book on personal finance I've ever read.\nOutliers http://amzn.to/28XqbzW. Best inspirational book and handbook on how to become exceptional at a skill.\nAbundance: http://amzn.to/290C1eP.

Each is a master piece. Read everything by Ken Follett to learn about history and enjoy the best story telling ever. He is my favorite author. I learned more history from this series than from any history class I've ever taken. Fall of Giants: http://amzn.to/290ALbr\nHarry Potter 1: http://amzn.to/28Xs3ZC My first audiobook. I learned english by listening to this book 22 times in a row.\nGame of Thrones: http://amzn.to/290rxuZ\nThe Way of Kings: http://amzn.to/29b5Cmw The main character is my favorite of any I've ever encountered. He has more determination and perseverance than any character I've come across, has excellent morals, and protects and cares for those around him.\n\nSciFi: \nDaemon http://amzn.to/29jP4aV The billionaire founder of a video game company gets neural cancer, but before he dies, he builds and AI that uses 3D printing and CNC to build technologies that are limited by patent laws, next the AI distributes this advanced technology to people it recruits to it's mission, etc. Excellent series, great view of what technology could do/how powerful it is and how it could take over the world. It was written in 2006 before the iPhone was put and yet it prominently features, heads up displays, haptic shirts, self driving cars, 3D printing etc. The next books by Daniel Suarez are about about a 24 year old who invents a way of selecting gravity waves http://amzn.to/29jRxC2 and computer vision enabled drones that can decipher context and make kill decisions on their own without human approval http://amzn.to/297gmUa.\nEnder's Game http://amzn.to/28Xu9s6.

As a result many feel out of control of their lives and the anger spills over. The WSJ survey bellow shows how americans spend their day. What if we move time from ""TV, leisure, sports"" into ""Education"" by creating games that actually educate someone into a new marketable profession when they complete all levels? To create an incentive for economically disadvantaged people to play, it can tie to a lottery that randomly distributes a large, life-changing payout to people who complete levels and pass a certification in the end. (you win by learning through playing, but it may change your life on a dime too) If that kind of lottery is also tied to a TV show that highlights outcomes / paths, it could change a lot of lives.

We\'re working on developing an application that is more user friendly with a better design, with a better user experience, and targeted  more towards younger people and older people as well. We also plan to be the place where you can get your tickets to events and concerts, because we see a great opportunity of making something better than what is already out there (eventbrite or ticketmaster). Overall,  we\'re mixing meetup and eventbrite to create something greater and even better. We\'re also working on establishing a premium service option in which the user pays 10 dollars a month to have access to all the gym and events in a specific area based on their interests and hobbies.  With this social platform we would implement a streaming service in the ""real world"". All of this and many more things we hope to have within our product. This is just a small glimpse of what Gathr can potentially be. We see a lot of opportunity in this because as social media and technology further isolates us we can or as a way to close the gap combat that problem.
